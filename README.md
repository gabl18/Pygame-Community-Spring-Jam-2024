The perfect Drink was made in one Week for the Pygame Community Spring Jam 2024 by gabl18 and sir_lordmike. 

Our Discord: gabl18 and sir_lordmike

This was our first jam and one of our first pygame projects. (For more details read the credits ingame) The Game consists of 9 Levels + 1 secret Bonus Level and some easter eggs! (For now)
There are 2 versions of the Game. 1 is scaled smaller than the other. Download what fits your Device best. The smaller Version of the Game could contain more bugs. The bigger Version has been tested more.

You are an Ice Cube that wants to get to a drink to make the drink perfect. But you need to be careful. You have to plattform across various obstacles while trying not to melt. The thermometer will indicate how fast you are melting. Can you manage to make "THE PERFECT DRINK"? 

Good Luck, and have fun!

I couldnt add assets here because there is a limit on how many files you can add and the assets folder has many small files. You can get the assets if you download the Game with itch.io.
